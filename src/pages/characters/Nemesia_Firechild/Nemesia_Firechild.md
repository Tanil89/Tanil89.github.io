# The seed of discord
This one-shot was made to test the manual for Goblin Slayer TTRPG, which would be officially released after 2 weeks.
Most of the players didn't know the rules so this adventure was designed to be easy to play in about 2 hours. No one had a background as it was a one-shot.
I played Nemesia Firechild, a priestess of the Supreme God.
Here is a list of the players' characters.
## Characters
* **Nemesia Firechild (Priestess):** She is a priestess of the Supreme God.
She can use her powers for 3 times a day. 
Her miracles are focused on healing (she can heal the wound and the disease),  she can banish a school of spells to an enemy for a short time, and she can understand the nature of an object.
* **Nuvus dust fingers**
